# GTM Package (V1)

## 1) Target Customer (Who Pays First)

Primary ICP:
- Solo founders and teams (1-15 people) shipping B2B SaaS, devtools, or ecommerce software.
- They need launch/demo videos quickly for landing pages, social posts, and outbound.
- They care about relevance and polish more than deep cinematic customization.

Non-ICP for V1:
- Avatar-first talking-head use cases.
- Enterprise procurement-heavy teams.
- Highly regulated sectors requiring custom legal review before publishing.

## 2) Positioning (What We Are / Are Not)

Smift is:
- URL-to-video engine for premium, artifact-first product videos.
- Fast draft-to-publish workflow optimized for startup products.

Smift is not:
- Avatar presenter generator.
- Generic stock-template slideshow tool.

Positioning statement:
- "Paste your product URL, get a premium artifact-first product video in minutes, then edit and publish."

## 3) Core Offer (Why Buy)

Primary promise:
- Get a high-quality 35-45s product video from URL with minimal manual work.

Offer bundle:
- URL intake -> structured script -> editable sections -> rerender -> export.
- Domain-aware packs for relevance and on-brand artifact scenes.
- Quality guardrails before final render.

Risk reversal:
- If first output is off-target, one guided regeneration cycle included.

## 4) Packaging + Pricing (V1)

Starter:
- $39/month
- 20 render credits
- Standard queue
- Email support

Growth:
- $99/month
- 80 render credits
- Faster queue
- Priority support

Top-up:
- $15 per 10 credits

Credit model:
- 1 credit = one render job (new generation rerender).
- Script-only quality checks do not consume credits.

## 5) Proof Assets Required Before Outreach

Need these assets live:
- 4 polished demo videos (core ICP verticals).
- Before/after examples (raw URL -> final video).
- One page showing quality and speed claims with concrete outputs.

Required operational metrics:
- URL-to-script success rate.
- URL-to-render success rate.
- Median time to first draft.

## 6) Launch Motion (First 30 Days)

Week 1:
- Finalize product demo set and landing copy.
- Start founder-led outbound to 50 ICP prospects.

Week 2:
- Onboard first 5 trial users manually.
- Track relevance feedback (accepted / partly relevant / off-target).

Week 3:
- Convert best-fit trials into paid Starter/Growth.
- Publish best 3 customer outputs as social proof (with consent).

Week 4:
- Iterate offer and onboarding based on objections and churn reasons.

## 7) Sales Script (Simple)

Problem:
- "You need product videos often, and production is slow/expensive."

Value:
- "Smift turns your URL into a premium demo video quickly, with editable script and rerender."

Proof:
- "Here are examples from products like yours and turnaround time."

Close:
- "Start on Starter for one month and judge output quality on your next launch cycle."

## 8) Execution Rules

- Do not add features that dilute the artifact-first, avatar-less position.
- Prioritize fixes that improve first-draft relevance and visible quality.
- Measure conversion and output acceptance weekly, not just model metrics.
