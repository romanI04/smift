# Launch Status (2026-02-13)

## What Smift Is (Today)

Smift is an avatar-less, artifact-first URL-to-video engine for startup-style product videos.

## What A Customer Can Do Now

- Sign up and log in.
- Get starter/growth plan state and credit balance.
- Generate from URL (script-only or full render).
- Edit script sections (hook, features, CTA), run quality checks, and rerender.
- Compare multiple versions, get best-version recommendation, and promote a winner.

## What Is Still Not Ready For Public Paid Launch

- No real payment processor yet (top-ups are manual credit actions).
- No production-grade account recovery, email verification, or admin controls.
- No hosted multi-tenant hardening pass yet (rate limits, monitoring, abuse controls).
- Engine quality still needs more real-customer benchmark evidence before broad launch.

## Current Stage

- Phase A (engine foundation): substantially complete.
- Phase B (workflow): mostly complete in local runner.
- Phase C (paid beta): started with minimum auth + billing + credits.

## Next Build Priorities

1. Replace manual top-up with real billing checkout.
2. Run weekly core-ICP benchmark and fix only customer-visible quality failures.
3. Add basic operator dashboard for failures, credits, and conversion funnel.
