# Product Vision (Scope Lock)

## Positioning

Smift is an **artifact-first**, **avatar-less** product video engine.

Core claim:
- URL in -> premium, credible, publish-ready product video draft out.

We do **not** compete on anthropomorphic presenters.
We compete on relevance, credibility, and visual polish of product artifacts.

## What We Are Building

- Product-story videos that feel native to the source company.
- Strong artifact scenes (UI, metrics, workflows, integrations) over talking-head simulation.
- Source-grounded messaging so claims map to real page evidence.

## Non-Goals (V1 + V1.5)

- No AI avatars as primary output.
- No realistic human presenter generation or lip-sync engine work.
- No "virtual host" product direction.

If a task mainly improves avatar realism, it is out of scope.

## Success Criteria

- First draft is relevant and credible without heavy editing.
- Visual language feels premium and domain-appropriate.
- User can fix one weak section quickly (regenerate/edit) without restarting.
- Output is trustworthy enough for founders to publish.

## Scope Lock Checklist (Required For Major Changes)

Every major change must answer "yes" to all:

1. Does this improve artifact quality, relevance, or credibility?
2. Does this preserve avatar-less output as default and strategic direction?
3. Is the improvement measurable in an existing quality/reliability gate?
4. Does it reduce time-to-publish or edit effort for customers?

If any answer is "no", do not prioritize the change.

## Decision Filter

When choosing between tasks, prioritize in this order:

1. Relevance/grounding quality
2. Artifact visual quality
3. Editability and regeneration workflow
4. Reliability/speed
5. Hosting/commercial plumbing

This order is mandatory unless a blocker prevents customer-visible output.
